# Crime Forecasting

Welcome to the **Crime Forecasting** project! This repository contains the code and methodology used to predict crime categories based on temporal and spatial analysis. The project leverages machine learning techniques to accurately forecast crime patterns, enabling better resource allocation and preventive measures.

## Overview

Crime forecasting is a powerful tool that can help law enforcement agencies and public safety organizations anticipate and respond to criminal activities. By analyzing historical crime data, this project aims to predict the type of crime that might occur at a given time and location.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model**: Implemented a sophisticated model using Python and scikit-learn to predict crime categories.
- **Data Analysis**: Performed detailed temporal and spatial analysis to understand crime patterns.
- **Feature Engineering**: Enhanced prediction accuracy through meticulous feature selection and engineering.
- **Cross-Validation**: Utilized comprehensive cross-validation techniques to improve model performance.
